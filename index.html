            <p>I hope everyone is doing as best as they can. With gyms closed for a month now due to the Covid-19 virus, 
                and NJ State Parks now too, it seems to be getting harder and harder to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>Good news is that with a little creativity, there is still alot you can do at home. So if you were just looking for 
                a little push or reminder, here it is. Here is a list of Mobility and Strength exercises you can do at home with ZERO
                pieces of equipment... well just a floor, bed, doorway and bath towel. I think you can all handle that.

            <h2>The Routine</h2> 
            <h3>Daily Mobility</h3>
            <p>Below is a Daily Mobility Routine that can be done daily. These are exercises I do throughout the course of the day.
                You can do them all at once, but you are free to incorporate them throughout the course of your day as you see fit.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cat-Cow Pose: 12 reps</li>
                <li>Child Pose: 30 - 90 seconds</li>
                <li>Lying Hamstring Stretch: 30 - 90 seconds</li>
                <li>Pec Stretch: 30 - 90 seconds</li>
                <li>Seated T-Spine Rotation: 6 reps each side </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Workout Routine</h3>
            <p>
                The Workout Routine is a group of exercises I would reccomend doing together all at once. Everybody is going to react differently
                to them. Start by going easy. If the next day you feel sore somewhere, let that muscle rest. Otherwise, feel free to do the exercises
                daily. Start with doing each exercise once, and the increasing the number of sets as you deem appropriate.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Glute Bridges: 12-15 reps</li>
                <li>Lying Leg Curls: 12-15 reps</li>
                <li>Dead Bug: 30 - 90 seconds</li>

            <h2>Mobility Exercises</h2>
            <ol class="flex">
                <li>Cat-Cow Pose</li>
                <img src="./resources/cat.jpeg" alt="Cat Cow Pose">
                <p>For this stretch, it is all about moving your spine through as much of a full range of motion as possible.
                    Sitting around leads our backs to maintain the same position all day long.
                </p>
                <p>With care and control, move your spine into each position, going only as far 
                    as you can tolerate. If you feel any pain, you are pushing too hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Move back and forth through each position slowly, focusing on controlled breathing as you hold
                    each position for a few seconds before moving to the next one.
                </p>
                <li>Child Pose</li>
                <img src="./resources/child.jpg" alt="Child Pose">
                <p>Here is another opportunity to get some spinal flexion, as well as some deep hip flexion in the hips</p>
                <li>Lying Hamstring Stretch</li>
                <img src="./resources/ham.jpeg" alt="Lying Hamstring Stretch">
                <p>It's everyone's favorite (said nobody ever). A Hamstring stretch. Though a band can help you pull
                    your hamstirng into a deeper stretch, it is not required if you do not have one at home.
                </p>
                <p>Simply keep both legs fully extended and lift one leg as high as you can.
                    Focus on taking deep breaths and not jerking your leg.
                </p>
                <li>Pec Stretch</li>
                <img src="./resources/pecstretch.jpg" alt="Pec Stretch">
                <p>Find yourself a doorway and lean in.
                    You can also do one side at a time if you feel a better stretch that way.
                </p>
                <li>Seated T-Spine Rotation</li>
                <img src="./resources/tspine.jpg" alt="Seated T-Spine Rotation">
                <p>Make sure to move slowly during this one, we don't want any hard jerking or twisitng.
                </p>
                <p>Sit nice and tall in a chair, cross your arms, and tighten your legs so as not to move the hips.
                    Your goal is to rotate as much as you can in either direction and just breath into wherever your body takes you.
                </p>

            <h2>Workout Exercises</h2>
            <ol class="flex">
                <li>Glute Bridges</li>
                <img src="./resources/glute.jpg" alt="Glute Bridge">
                <p>Start off laying flat on your back, brace your core
                    and press through your legs to lift your hips into the air.
                    Make sure to squeeze you glutes.
                </p>
                <li>Lying Leg Curls</li>
                <img src="./resources/towelcurl.jpg" alt="Lying Leg Curl">
                <p>This time, make sure you're own a hard floor so that your
                     towel is able to slide. You are going to perform a glute bridge like before, 
                     but instead of lowering your hips, exhale as you extend your knees, using your feet to
                     push the towel away from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you pull your legs back towards you inhale. You should feel a nice burn in 
                    your hamstrings. Start off my only moving your legs forward and back a short
                    distance
                </p>
                <li>Dead Bug</li>
                <img src="./resources/deadbug.jpeg" alt="Dead Bug">
                <p>
                    Now we are going to focus on some spinal stabilization.
                    Start off by laying on your back and keep both knees bent with both
                    legs on the floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, you are going to exhale as you lift one leg to a 90
                    degree position as shown above. 
                    Note however, you will still keep one leg on the ground.
                    Breathe in as you lower back down. Continue by doing the same on
                    the opposite leg now, alternating back and forth betwen each leg.
                    Focus on just tapping the ground gently, dont let your foot slam down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this position has been mastered you can do a more advanced
                    variation where you lift both legs up as show in the photo above.
                    From here, exhale as you lower one leg, inhale to lift it back up,
                    and then exhale as you lower the other leg. Continue in this fashion.
                </p>
                <li>Eccentric Squats</li>
                <img src="./resources/squat.jpg" alt="Squat">
                <p>
                We are going to use something like a chair (without wheels) or couch a in this variation to take as much 
                stress of the knees as possible. Keep in mind out focus on this exercise is to work the 
                muscles in the leg. Stop immediately if after following the below isntructions you
                feel stress in the knees or lower back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extend your arms forward and reach your hips back to slowly lower towards your seat. 
                    You may need to experiment with finding the right height, as you want to maintain control
                    and balance as you descend down. You don't want to fall into you seated position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to descend down as slowly as possible. Focusing on this eccentric range of 
                    motion slowly and with control is the best way to strengthen the muscles.
                    Tap your seat gently, and then stand up tall, drivng through the legs and squeezing
                    your glutes. 
                </p>
                <li>Doorway Pushups</li>
                <img src="./resources/pushup.jpg" alt="Doorway Pushups">
                <p>Find a safe and stable doorway to do some pushups. You are going to set up nice and tall
                    in a plank position and lean forward. Lower yourself through the doorway like you would during
                    a push up and then press back to the top.
                </p>
                <li>Prone Overhead Reach</li>
                <img src="./resources/overhead.jpg" alt="Prone Overhead Reach">
                <p>
                    This is a great workout for the shoulders in the upper back and shoulders, and it is okay if
                    you can only do a few repetitions at a time at first. Start by laying flat on your stomach.
                    If this position is uncomfortable on the floor, you can also perform this by laying on something
                    softer like a bed.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Tuck your chin so you are nice and tall, lifting your head off of the floor and reach you arms forward
                   as shown in the photo above.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                   A good way to envision the next part of this motion is to pretend your holding a single bar in both hands. Reach your arms forward,
                   lifting the bar overhead. Then, bring the bar behind your head as you squeeze your shoudler blades and lats.
                   Repeat this motion.
                </p>
